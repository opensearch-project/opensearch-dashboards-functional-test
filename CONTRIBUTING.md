## Contributing to OpenSearch

OpenSearch is a community project that is built and maintained by people just like **you**. We're glad you're interested in helping out. There are several different ways you can do it, but before we talk about that, let's talk about how to get started.

## Developer Guide

### Install Dependencies

#### opensearch-dashboards-test-library

opensearch-dashboards-test-library is the test utility library used by this project, it is already a published package in NPM. You can import the lastest version by installing from NPM registry

```
"@opensearch-dashboards-test/opensearch-dashboards-test-library": "^1.0.1"
```

You can also import from the git repository target branch to use the development code directly

```
"@opensearch-dashboards-test/opensearch-dashboards-test-library": "opensearch-project/opensearch-dashboards-test-library#main"
```

You need to delete the package from the node_modules folder and run npm install again, to reflect the change.

```
$ npm uninstall @opensearch-dashboards-test/opensearch-dashboards-test-library && npm install opensearch-project/opensearch-dashboards-test-library#main
```

### Run Tests

You can run the cypress tests by cli. There are some handy scripts in [package.json](package.json) to run the tests with some pre-set configurations.

To run tests against a local cluster

without security:

```
$ yarn cypress run-without-security --spec "cypress/integration/core-opensearch-dashboards/vanilla-opensearch-dashboards/*.js"
```

with security:

```
$ yarn cypress run-with-security --spec "cypress/integration/core-opensearch-dashboards/opensearch-dashboards/*.js"
```

These tests run in headless mode by default. You can also manually trigger the test via browser UI by running:

```
$ yarn cypress open
```

And you can override certain [cypress config or environment variable](cypress.json) by applying additional cli arguments, for example to override the baseUrl and openSearchUrl to test a remote OpenSearch endpoint:

```
$ yarn cypress run --spec "cypress/integration/core-opensearch-dashboards/opensearch-dashboards/*.js" --config "baseUrl=https://<endpoint>/_dashboards" --env "openSearchUrl=https://<endpoint>,SECURITY_ENABLED=true,username=admin,password=xxxxxxxx,ENDPOINT_WITH_PROXY=true"
```

`SECURITY_ENABLED`: if true, the `username` and `password` passing in are used as basic authentication credentials during `cy.visit` and `cy.request`. Also, please notice security enabled endpoint normally uses https protocol, so you may want to pass in different urls.

`ENDPOINT_WITH_PROXY`: for an OpenSearch endpoint wrapped with a proxy that redirects the visiting url to the login url, even with auth option provided in `cy.visit`, the redirection to the login url still happens. So a login request before tests and cache the security cookie are needed and can be switched on by this argument.

`MANAGED_SERVICE_ENDPOINT`: set to true if tests are running against managed service domains.

### Formatting

`prettier` and `ESLint` is integrated and used to standardize formatting of files, where `prettier` takes care of the code formatting and `ESLint` takes care of the code style. You can check the formatting of all files (new and existing) by running

```
$ yarn lint
```
and auto fix the formatting of all files (new and existing) by running
```
$ yarn lint --fix
```

`Husky` precommit hook is used to automatically run `yarn lint`, please fix the files according to lint result before commiting code changes (run `yarn lint --fix` for fixable errors, or manully fix code according to error messages). If you have any doubts on `ESLint` rules, feel free to [open an issue](issues).

### Onboarding

To onboard your release tests (Dashboards plugins) onto this repo test function, you can follow the next steps.

0. Create a name to identify your plugin, e.g `plugin-name`

The dir name shall be descriptive to identify your plugin. You can use the same name defined in build repo https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/tree/main/scripts/components

1. Place test files under `cypress/integration/plugins/<plugin-name>`

2. Place fixtures under `cypress/fixtures/plugins/<plugin-name>`

3. Place custom commands under `cypress/utils/plugins/<plugin-name>`, if it's a general command that could be reused by other plugins, place it under `cypress/utils/commands.js`

4. Place custom constants under `cypress/utils/plugins/<plugin-name>`, reuse the constants in `cypress/utils/base_constants.js`

5. Run tests

Start OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards. Then refer to the [test execution file](/integtest.sh).

E.g if you want to run all plugin tests with security enabled.

```
npx cypress run --env SECURITY_ENABLED=true --spec "cypress/integration/plugins/*/*"
```

E.g if you want to run AD plugin tests with security enabled.

```
npx cypress run --env SECURITY_ENABLED=true --spec "cypress/integration/plugins/anomaly-detection-dashboards-plugin"
```

For the complete ways to run Cypress, you can refer to the Cypress official site https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/.installing-cypress#Opening-Cypress.

The env parameters are defined in https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-dashboards-functional-test/blob/main/cypress.json where you can look for or add the desired parameters. You can refer to the Cypress official site https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables#Setting.

6. [optional] Remove copied tests from your plugin and execute them remotely from your plugin

Since your release tests have been moved in this repo, to avoid maintain duplicated code and potentially diverged Cypress versions in two repos, you can remove them from your plugin. Then execute the tests inside this repo from your CI. See AD's example https://github.com/opensearch-project/anomaly-detection-dashboards-plugin/blob/main/.github/workflows/remote-integ-tests-workflow.yml However, this can be decided at plugin level to phase out the changes.

7. [optional] Verify test execution from OpenSearch build repo

The tests inside this repo will be executed from OpenSearch build repo. You can verify that by running test script from https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/tree/main/src/test_workflow Please refer to the repo to the way of test exeuction. Below is the set of commands you can use based on current situation.

Suppose your plugin is ready for version 1.2.0

```
./build.sh manifests/1.2.0/opensearch-1.2.0.yml

./build.sh manifests/1.2.0/opensearch-dashboards-1.2.0.yml

./assemble.sh builds/opensearch/manifest.yml

./assemble.sh builds/opensearch-dashboards/manifest.yml

./test.sh integ-test manifests/1.2.0/opensearch-dashboards-1.2.0-test.yml

```

### Test Development

#### Experimental Features

When writing tests for experimental features, please follow these steps.

1. Figure out the folder location to put the tests

Similar to the regular tests, OSD Core tests go to the [folder](integration/core-opensearch-dashboards/opensearch-dashboards/) and OSD plugin tests go to the [folder](cypress/integration/plugins/).

2. Develop tests with a flag to turn on and off

Add an environment variable (e.g boolean) to only run tests for the experiemental feature when it is true. (Define such in [cypress configuration](cypress.json). Refer to `SECURITY_ENABLED` as an example) This is to ensure backward compatibility when integrating with [opensearch-build repo](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/blob/main/src/test_workflow/integ_test/service_opensearch_dashboards.py) whose OpenSearch Dashboards execution command or yml configuration may not be updated to support the experimental feature yet.

3. Set up Github action to run the tests inside the current repo

Create a new workflow by referring to [this template](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-dashboards-functional-test/blob/main/.github/workflows/release-e2e-workflow-template.yml) for OSD plugin or [this workflow](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-dashboards-functional-test/blob/main/.github/workflows/cypress-workflow-vanilla-snapshot-based.yml) for OSD Core. This workflow is to run the OSD from artifact. You could enable your experimental feature through either `./bin/opensearch-dashboards --vis_builder.enabled` or through modifying the content of the yml file. (In order to run the tests from the source code repo of the feature, you can set up workflows to check out the source code and use `yarn` to start OSD.)

4. Run tests from `opensearch-build`

To make the build repo enable your experimental feature when spinning up OSD service, make sure that you update [this file](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/blob/main/src/test_workflow/integ_test/service_opensearch_dashboards.py) You could either modify the start command or the yml file. To avoid a potentially long start command, it is preferred to modify the yml file to turn on the feature.

## Release

This project follows [OpenSearch project branching, labelling, and releasing](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/RELEASING.md#opensearch-branching) to track 3 releases in parallel.

## First Things First

1. **When in doubt, open an issue** - For almost any type of contribution, the first step is opening an issue. Even if you think you already know what the solution is, writing down a description of the problem you're trying to solve will help everyone get context when they review your pull request. If it's truly a trivial change (e.g. spelling error), you can skip this step -- but as the subject says, when it doubt, [open an issue](issues).

2. **Only submit your own work** (or work you have sufficient rights to submit) - Please make sure that any code or documentation you submit is your work or you have the rights to submit. We respect the intellectual property rights of others, and as part of contributing, we'll ask you to sign your contribution with a "Developer Certificate of Origin" (DCO) that states you have the rights to submit this work and you understand we'll use your contribution. There's more information about this topic in the [DCO section](#developer-certificate-of-origin).

## Ways to Contribute

### Bug Reports

Ugh! Bugs!

A bug is when software behaves in a way that you didn't expect and the developer didn't intend. To help us understand what's going on, we first want to make sure you're working from the latest version.

Once you've confirmed that the bug still exists in the latest version, you'll want to check to make sure it's not something we already know about on the [open issues GitHub page](issues).

If you've upgraded to the latest version and you can't find it in our open issues list, then you'll need to tell us how to reproduce it Provide as much information as you can. You may think that the problem lies with your query, when actually it depends on how your data is indexed. The easier it is for us to recreate your problem, the faster it is likely to be fixed.

### Feature Requests

If you've thought of a way that OpenSearch could be better, we want to hear about it. We track feature requests using GitHub, so please feel free to open an issue which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

### Documentation Changes

TODO

### Contributing Code

As with other types of contributions, the first step is to [open an issue on GitHub](issues/new/choose). Opening an issue before you make changes makes sure that someone else isn't already working on that particular problem. It also lets us all work together to find the right approach before you spend a bunch of time on a PR. So again, when in doubt, open an issue.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

OpenSearch is an open source product released under the Apache 2.0 license (see either [the Apache site](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or the [LICENSE.txt file](LICENSE.txt)). The Apache 2.0 license allows you to freely use, modify, distribute, and sell your own products that include Apache 2.0 licensed software.

We respect intellectual property rights of others and we want to make sure all incoming contributions are correctly attributed and licensed. A Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight mechanism to do that.

The DCO is a declaration attached to every contribution made by every developer. In the commit message of the contribution, the developer simply adds a `Signed-off-by` statement and thereby agrees to the DCO, which you can find below or at [DeveloperCertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/).

```
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the
    best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open
    source license and I have the right under that license to
    submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole
    or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless
    I am permitted to submit under a different license), as
    Indicated in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including
    all personal information I submit with it, including my
    sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed
    consistent with this project or the open source license(s)
    involved.
```

We require that every contribution to OpenSearch is signed with a Developer Certificate of Origin. Additionally, please use your real name. We do not accept anonymous contributors nor those utilizing pseudonyms.

Each commit must include a DCO which looks like this

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@email.com>
```

You may type this line on your own when writing your commit messages. However, if your user.name and user.email are set in your git configs, you can use `-s` or `– – signoff` to add the `Signed-off-by` line to the end of the commit message.

## License Headers

New files in your code contributions should contain the following license header. If you are modifying existing files with license headers, or including new files that already have license headers, do not remove or modify them without guidance.

## Review Process

We deeply appreciate everyone who takes the time to make a contribution. We will review all contributions as quickly as possible. As a reminder, [opening an issue](issues/new/choose) discussing your change before you make it is the best way to smooth the PR process. This will prevent a rejection because someone else is already working on the problem, or because the solution is incompatible with the architectural direction.

During the PR process, expect that there will be some back-and-forth. Please try to respond to comments in a timely fashion, and if you don't wish to continue with the PR, let us know. If a PR takes too many iterations for its complexity or size, we may reject it. Additionally, if you stop responding we may close the PR as abandoned. In either case, if you feel this was done in error, please add a comment on the PR.

If we accept the PR, a [maintainer](MAINTAINERS.md) will merge your change and usually take care of backporting it to appropriate branches ourselves. For the backporting process, once the PR is merged a [maintainer](MAINTAINERS.md) will label it with the appropriate target branch then the backport workflow will do the rest. For example, the label `backport 1.x` label will be added to the PR that is to be backported to `1.x`. The backport branches are named in the form `backport/backport-<original PR number>-to-<base>`. These branches will be cleaned up by an auto delete workflow once the backport PR is merged.

If we reject the PR, we will close the pull request with a comment explaining why. This decision isn't always final: if you feel we have misunderstood your intended change or otherwise think that we should reconsider then please continue the conversation with a comment on the PR and we'll do our best to address any further points you raise.
